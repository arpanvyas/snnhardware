1. Generate the spikes from input image and running spike_train.py on the image.
	For this set the path of input image in spike_train.py in variable "input_image"
	To get the output spikes file change the variable "output_spikes"

2. In the testbench instead of "./testbench_files/train4.txt" set the file "output_spikes" generated from spike_train.py

3. Run the simulation.

4. Run generating.py, this takes the output weights generated from running the simulation.

5. Neuron image as neuron0.png, neuron1.png, neuron2.png.


Thus 
input_image --> spike_train.py --> output_spikes --> tb.v --> "./testbench_files/init_weight0.dat" (the trained image in weights form) --> generating.py --> neuron0.png



Run generating.py file

Change the path of three weight files in the end to the RAM weights generated from the main testbench file.
The neuron images will be generated on running the file.
